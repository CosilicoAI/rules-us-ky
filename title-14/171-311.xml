          <p>The Kentucky Historical Society shall educate and engage the public through Kentucky history in order to confront the issues of the future. To that end, the society shall collect, maintain, and preserve authentic records, information, and artifacts connected with the history of the Commonwealth and the genealogy of her peoples; and promote a wider appreciation of the American heritage, with particular emphasis on the advancement and dissemination of knowledge of the history of Kentucky. The society may receive and hold by donation or devise, real or personal property to any extent and may, by gift, loan, purchase, or otherwise hold books, papers, documents, historical memorials, and any other articles suited to promote the objects of the society in the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History, the Old State Capitol Building, or the Kentucky Military History Museum, but all such property shall be held in trust for the Commonwealth of Kentucky according to the terms of acceptance.</p>
          <p>All persons, partnerships, corporations, or associations who shall evidence their dedication to the promotion of the objects and purposes of the society may become active members thereof upon their approval under regulations prescribed by the governing board and the payment of annual dues in a sum determined by the governing board. The governing board may determine classes of memberships and establish respective rates of dues. Every member in good standing, including the authorized representative of an institutional member, shall have the right to vote in person or by proxy, hold office, and otherwise take part in the proceedings of the society. Membership may be terminated by resignation or nonpayment of dues.</p>
          <p>The officers of the society shall be a chancellor, who shall be the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a president, first, second, and third vice presidents, who shall be ex officio members of the governing board.

          <p>There is hereby created a governing board which shall consist of sixteen (16) members, the officers of the society, and one (1) person designated annually by the State Archives and Records Commission.

It shall establish and prescribe the duties of such other positions as are necessary to operate the society, and all persons engaged to fill such positions shall be employed by the executive director, subject to the approval of the governing board , which approval shall constitute exemption from  to 18A.200, and their work shall be under the executive director’s supervision.</p>
          <p>The governing board shall provide for the publication or preservation of historical documents and manuscripts; publish, including by electronic means, an edition to be known as the “Register”; provide by contract, subject to the approval of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, for all the printing, publication, and distribution of, including by electronic means, reports, books, and other publications calculated to promote and advance the historical interest of Kentucky and augment the society’s various collections at all times. It shall supervise and direct the ordinary affairs of the society; appoint a nominating committee; and determine other necessary committees of which the president and the executive director of the society shall be ex officio members. The governing board shall cooperate with, provide assistance to, and coordinate its functions with those of the state Archives and Records Commission. It may designate honorary members of the society and it shall have the power to fill any vacancies until the next annual meeting, including those occurring within its own membership.</p>
          <p>The governing board shall hold regular meetings in January, April, July, and October. Matters to be determined and discussed at meetings shall be furnished to the executive director at least ten (10) days prior to meetings in order that he may prepare and distribute an agenda to each member of the governing board at least three (3) days before the meeting. Special meetings shall be held at the request of the president or any three (3) members of the governing board, in which case the executive director shall give written notice together with the agenda of the meeting at least ten (10) days in advance. In an emergency, nine (9) members of the committee may waive the provision of notice.</p>

Special meetings may be called in Frankfort or elsewhere by the president or a majority of the governing board or by the executive director upon the written request of twenty (20) members of the society. Members shall have fifteen (15) days written notice of the time, place, and subject of the meeting.</p>
          <p>Twenty-five (25) members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business at any meeting of the society, and one-third (1/3) of the membership of the governing board shall constitute a quorum at their respective meetings.</p>
          <p>The Chancellor of the Society, at his discretion, may preside at any meeting of the society or the governing board, or he may participate otherwise in any meetings.</p>
          <p>The president of the society shall be the chief executive officer of the society and shall preside over meetings of the society or the governing board in the absence of the chancellor or at his request. He shall recommend the appointment of all necessary or desirable committees and he shall name persons to comprise committees, except the nominating committee.</p>

Upon the call for the election of officers, the president shall promptly report the nomination by the nominating committee together with all other nominations. When more than the required number of candidates have been nominated for membership on the governing board or more than one (1) candidate for the offices to be filled, the president shall call for an election by the vote of those present, together with the number of votes cast by proxy, and a plurality of all votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. Where no vote count is required, the president shall cast one (1) vote for each candidate and he or she shall be declared elected.</p>
          <p>This charter may be amended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the members present and voting at any regular meeting or at any special meeting of the society called for the purpose, provided that written notice containing the substance of the proposed amendments shall have been distributed by mail or electronically to members not less than thirty (30) days in advance of such meeting and the same approved as an amendment by the first General Assembly, meeting after the action of the society.</p>
