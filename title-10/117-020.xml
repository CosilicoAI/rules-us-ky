          <p>The State Board of Elections
    may declare a county to be a preclearance county for election purposes when
    that county has a history of voter fraud, noncompliance with election laws,
    or voter complaints about the integrity of a particular election. In a county
    designated as a preclearance county, all decisions of the county board of
    elections shall be reported to the State Board of Elections for its review.
    The failure of a county board of elections of a preclearance county to submit
    its decisions to the State Board of Elections for its review shall constitute
    a prima facie case for appointment of an election manager under .
    The State Board of Elections may require a preclearance county to submit evidence
    or justification as required by the state board which is necessary to evaluate
    the county board’s decisions. A county designated as a preclearance county
    shall retain that designation until it is removed by the State Board of Elections.</p>
