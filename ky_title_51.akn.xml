to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to strengthening and maintaining the biological family unit; to ensuring that policies and practices utilized are supported by data and research and are monitored or measured for their effectiveness in achieving the intended results; and to offering all available resources to any family in need of them; (b)It also shall be declared to be the policy of this Commonwealth that: 1.All efforts shall be directed toward providing each child a safe and nurturing home; 2.Emphasis shall be placed on involving families in interventions developed for youth, providing families with access to services necessary to address issues within the family, and increasing accountability of the youth and families within the juvenile justice system; 3.To the extent possible, out-of-home placement should only be utilized for youth who are high-risk or high-level offenders, and that low-risk, low-level offenders should be served through evidence-based programming in their community; and 4.As the population in Department of Juvenile Justice facilities is reduced through increased use of community-based treatment, and if staffing ratios can be maintained at the levels required by accreditation bodies, reductions of the number of facilities should be considered; (c)The court shall show that other less restrictive alternatives have been attempted or are not feasible in order to insure that children are not removed from families except when absolutely necessary; (d)Any child brought before the court under KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall have a right to treatment reasonably calculated, through the use of evidence-based programs when available, to bring about an improvement of his or her condition and, to the extent possible, have that treatment administered in the county of residence of the custodial parent or parents or in the nearest available county; (e)KRS Chapter 635 shall be interpreted to promote the best interests of the child through providing treatment and sanctions to reduce recidivism and assist in making the child a productive citizen by involving the family, as appropriate, and by advancing the principles of personal responsibility, accountability, and reformation, while maintaining public safety, and seeking restitution and reparation; (f)KRS Chapter 640 shall be interpreted to promote public safety and the concept that every child be held accountable for his or her conduct through the use of restitution, reparation, and sanctions, in an effort to rehabilitate delinquent youth; and (g)It shall further be the policy of this Commonwealth to provide judicial procedures in which rights and interests of all parties, including the parents and victims, are recognized and all parties are assured prompt and fair hearings. Unless otherwise provided, such protections belong to the child individually and may not be waived by any other party.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_600_020"><akn:num>600.020</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions for KRS Chapters 600 to 645.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>As used in KRS Chapters 600 to 645, unless the context otherwise requires:</akn:p><akn:point eId="sec_600_020__point_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>“Abused or neglected child” means a child whose health or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm when:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>(a)His or her parent, guardian, person in a position of authority or special trust, as defined in KRS 532.045, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child: 1.Inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or emotional injury as defined in this section by other than accidental means; 2.Creates or allows to be created a risk of physical or emotional injury as defined in this section to the child by other than accidental means; 3.Engages in a pattern of conduct that renders the parent incapable of caring for the immediate and ongoing needs of the child, including but not limited to parental incapacity due to a substance use disorder as defined in KRS 222.005; 4.Continuously or repeatedly fails or refuses to provide essential parental care and protection for the child, considering the age of the child; 5.Commits or allows to be committed an act of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or prostitution upon the child; 6.Creates or allows to be created a risk that an act of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or prostitution will be committed upon the child; 7.Abandons or exploits the child; 8.Does not provide the child with adequate care, supervision, food, clothing, shelter, and education or medical care necessary for the child’s well-being when financially able to do so or offered financial or other means to do so.

PURPOSE. The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. sec. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:</akn:p><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_11"><akn:num>(11)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_12"><akn:num>(12)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_615_010__point_13"><akn:num>(13)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles, particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.

If a violation is found to have occurred, the court may consider other dispositional alternatives pursuant to this section; (b)Protective orders, such as the following: 1.Requiring the parent or any other person to abstain from any conduct abusing, neglecting, or making the child dependent; 2.Placing the child in his or her own home under supervision of the cabinet or its designee with services as determined to be appropriate by the cabinet; and 3.Orders authorized by KRS 403.715 to 403.785 and by KRS Chapter 456; (c)Removal of the child to the custody of an adult relative, fictive kin, other person, or child-caring facility or child-placing agency, taking into consideration the wishes of the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision. Before any child is committed to the cabinet or placed out of his or her home under the supervision of the cabinet, the court shall determine that reasonable efforts have been made by the court or the cabinet to prevent or eliminate the need for removal and that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.
