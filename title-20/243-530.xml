The licensee shall at once surrender its license to the department.If the license revoked is for premises located in any city that has a police force of its own, the department, immediately upon mailing notice of the revocation of the license to the licensee, shall mail to the chief of the police department of that city a written notice stating the fact of the revocation, the name of the licensee whose license was revoked, the address of the premises that had been licensed under the revoked license, and the date of the revocation. If the license revoked is for premises that are not located in any city with a police force of its own, the department shall in like manner and at like time mail a similar notice to the sheriff of the county in which the premises are located. If the revoked license is not surrendered at once by the licensee, the chief of the police department or sheriff shall, at the request of the department, immediately cause one of its officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the department.</p>
