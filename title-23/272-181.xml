The bylaws of the association may authorize the creation and fix the responsibilities of any other office. Every officer of a corporation, by acceptance of election or appointment as an officer, including by service, shall be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for any action by, in the name of, or on behalf of the corporation.</p>
