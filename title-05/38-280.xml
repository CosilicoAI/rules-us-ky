          <p>Every officer and enlisted man shall be personally responsible to the state for loss or damage to public property issued to him, and no one shall be relieved from liability, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Governor that the loss of or damage to the property was unavoidable and in no way the fault of the person responsible for the property. The value of the property lost or damaged, in the amount determined by a surveying officer or a board, shall be charged against the person at fault or, with the concurrence of its commanding officer, to the command to or for which it has been issued, and, if not relieved from the charge by the Governor, it shall be an indebtedness from the person or command to the state. The value of property lost or damaged for which an enlisted man is liable shall be charged against his pay by his commanding officer, and collected on such forms and under such regulations as may be prescribed.</p>
