          <p>A majority of the board shall constitute a quorum and the board shall act by vote of a majority present at any meeting attended by a quorum. Vacancies in the board shall not affect its power or authority so long as a quorum remains. Within ten (10) days after appointment and qualification of members, the board shall hold a meeting and elect a chairman. The board shall at the same time elect a secretary-treasurer, and shall fix his compensation. The board shall hold public meetings at least once each month, at such regular time and place as the board may determine. Changes in such time and place of meeting shall be made known to the public as far in advance as practicable. Any special meeting may be called by the chairman or by two (2) members of the board, but, if such special meeting is called, written notice shall be sent to all members of the board by the chairman or secretary-treasurer. Except as otherwise expressly provided, the board shall establish its own bylaws and rules of procedure.</p>
