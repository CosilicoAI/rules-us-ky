activities described in paragraph (l) of subsection (1) of this section that are attributable to this Commonwealth. a.The amount of interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero (0), and other income from investment assets and activities in the investment account to be attributed to this Commonwealth and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying all income from the assets and activities by a fraction the numerator of which is the average value of the assets that are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the financial institution within this Commonwealth and the denominator of which is the average value of all the assets. b.The amount of interest from federal funds sold and purchased and from securities purchased under resale agreements and securities

using the rules for determining the average value of tangible personal property set forth in KRS 136.535(3) and (4). 2.In lieu of using the method set forth in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, the financial institution may elect, or the department may require in order to fairly represent the business activity of the financial institution in this Commonwealth, the use of the method set forth in this subparagraph. a.The amount of interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero (0), and other income from investment assets and activities in the investment account to be attributed to this Commonwealth and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying all income from assets and activities by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from assets and activities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the financial institution within this Commonwealth and the denominator of which is the gross income from all assets and activities. b.The amount of interest from federal funds sold and purchased and from securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements attributable to this Commonwealth and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph 1. of paragraph (l) of subsection (1) of this section from funds and securities by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from funds and securities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the financial institution within this Commonwealth and the denominator of which is the gross income from all funds and securities. c.The amount of interest, dividends, gains, and other income from trading assets and activities, including but not limited to assets and activities in the matched

numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph 2. of paragraph (l) of subsection (1) of this section by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from trading assets and activities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the financial institution within this Commonwealth and the denominator of which is the gross income from all assets and activities. 3.If the financial institution elects or is required by the department to use the method set forth in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph, it shall use this method on all subsequent returns unless the financial institution receives prior permission from the department to use, or the department requires, a different method. 4.The financial institution shall have the burden of proving that an investment asset or activity or trading asset or activity was properly assigned to a regular place of business outside this Commonwealth by demonstrating that the day-to-day decisions regarding the asset or activity occurred at a regular place of business outside this Commonwealth. Where the day-to-day decisions regarding an investment asset or activity or trading asset or activity occur at more than one (1) regular place of business and one (1) regular place of business is in this Commonwealth and one (1) regular place of business is outside this Commonwealth, the asset or activity shall be considered to be located at the regular place of business of the financial institution where the investment or trading policies or guidelines with respect to the asset or activity are established. Unless the financial institution demonstrates to the contrary, the policies and guidelines shall be presumed to be established at the commercial domicile of the financial institution. (m)The numerator of the receipts factor includes all other receipts derived from sales as determined in KRS 141.901. (n) 1.All receipts that would be assigned under this section to a state in which the financial institution is not taxable shall be included in the numerator of the receipts factor, if the financial institution’s commercial domicile is in this Commonwealth. 2.For purposes of subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, “taxable” means either: a.That a financial institution is subject in another state to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, a corporate stock tax including a bank shares tax, a single business tax, an earned surplus tax, or any tax which is imposed upon or measured by net income; or b.That another state has statutory authority to subject the financial institution to any of the taxes in subdivision a. of this subparagraph, whether in fact the state does or does not impose the tax.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_136_535"><akn:num>136.535</akn:num><akn:heading>Calculation of property factor.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:point eId="sec_136_535__point_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>As used in this section:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>(a)“Administration” means the process of managing an account.

Taxing tobacco products according to relative risk is a rational tax policy and may well serve the public health goal of reducing smoking-related mortality and morbidity and lowering health care costs associated with tobacco-related disease.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_138_140__point_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Any person subject to the taxes imposed under subsections (1) and (2) of this section that:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>(a)Files an application related to a modified risk tobacco product shall report to the department that an application has been filed within thirty (30) days of that filing; and (b)Receives an order authorizing the marketing of a modified risk tobacco product shall report to the department that an authorizing order has been received.</akn:p><akn:point eId="sec_138_140__point_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Upon receipt of the information required by subsection (7)(b) of this section, the department shall reduce the tax imposed on the modified risk tobacco product as required by subsection (3)(b) of this section on the first day of the calendar month following the expiration of forty-five (45) days following receipt of the information required by subsection (7)(b) of this section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_138_143"><akn:num>138.143</akn:num><akn:heading>Floor stocks tax on cigarettes, snuff, and other tobacco products — Rates — Required returns — Installment payments.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:point eId="sec_138_143__point_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Every retailer, sub-jobber, resident wholesaler, nonresident wholesaler, and unclassified acquirer shall:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>(a)Take a physical inventory of all cigarettes in packages bearing Kentucky tax stamps, and all unaffixed Kentucky cigarette tax stamps possessed by them or in their control at 11:59 p.m. on June 30, 2018.
