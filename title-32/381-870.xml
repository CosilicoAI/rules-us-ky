          <p>All co-owners are bound to contribute in accordance with their percentage of common interest toward the expenses of administration and of maintenance, repairs and replacement reserves of the general common elements, and, in the proper case, of the limited common elements of the regime, and toward any other expenses lawfully assessed under the master deed and/or by the council of co-owners. Provided, however, that the master deed may provide for adjustments by the council of co-owners for contributions proportioned upon a consideration of a combination of floor area, the number of occupants, demand on public utilities and accessibility to limited common elements. No owner shall be exempt from contributing toward such expenses by waiver of the use or enjoyment of the common elements, both general and limited, or by abandonment of the unit belonging to him; provided, abatement or reduction in an owner’s contribution may be granted by the council of co-owners for a reasonable period of time, during which a unit is uninhabitable as the result of damage or destruction.</p>
