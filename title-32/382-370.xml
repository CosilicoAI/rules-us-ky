          <p>Powers of attorney to convey or release real or personal property, or any interest therein, may be acknowledged, proved and recorded in the proper office, in the manner prescribed for recording conveyances. If the conveyance made under a power, is required by law to be recorded or lodged for record, to make the same valid against creditors and purchasers, then the power must be lodged or recorded in like manner, and no such power so recorded shall be deemed to be revoked by any act of the party by whom it was executed, except from the time when there has been lodged for record in the office in which the power is recorded a written revocation, executed and proved or acknowledged in the manner prescribed for conveyances, or a memorandum of revocation made on the margin of the record thereof, which memorandum is signed by the party executing the same, and attested by the clerk.</p>
