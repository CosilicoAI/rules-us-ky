          <p>Weights and measures that have been rejected under the authority of the director or of a sealer shall remain subject to the control of the rejecting authority until such time as suitable repair or disposition thereof has been made as required by this section. The owners of such rejected weights and measures shall cause the same to be made correct within thirty (30) days or such shorter period as may be authorized by the rejecting authority; or, in lieu of this, may dispose of the same, but only in such manner as is specifically authorized by the rejecting authority. Weights and measures that have been rejected shall not again be used commercially until they have been officially reexamined and found to be correct, or until specific written permission for such use is issued by the rejecting authority, or until the rejection tag has been removed and the rejected device repaired and placed in service by a person duly registered to perform such acts under a regulation issued by the director for the registration of weights and measures servicemen and service agencies.</p>
