          <p>When a minor or other person under disability, having no guardian or conservator, is entitled to receive a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), exclusive of interest, in any action in which real estate has been sold or in the settlement of any estate or from any other source, the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability may settle or compromise the dollar amount when in the interest of the minor or other person under disability. The court in which the action is pending, or, if the sum does not derive from the action, the District Court, may order the sum to be paid to the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability. Before entering the order, the court shall approve any settlement or compromise and shall be satisfied by affidavit or oral testimony that the minor or other person under disability is in the custody of the person to whom it is proposed to pay the money and the latter, upon withdrawal of the money, shall be under obligation as trustee to expend it, for the support, maintenance, or education of the minor or other person under disability. When the order is made, no bond shall be required of the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability and the purchaser of the real property may pay the share of the minor or other person under disability into court, and no lien shall remain on the property therefor and the money may be withdrawn by the person mentioned in the order without that person giving bond. A release executed by the person to whom the court has ordered the sum paid shall have the same effect as a release by a duly appointed guardian.</p>
