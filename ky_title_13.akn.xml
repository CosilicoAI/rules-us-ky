Purpose and Policy A.It is the purpose of this compact to: 1.Establish and maintain close cooperation and understanding among executive, legislative, professional educational and lay leadership on a nationwide basis at the state and local levels. 2.Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education. 3.Provide a clearing house of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education. 4.Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods and facilities. B.It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states. C.The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states. Article II. State Defined As used in this compact, “state” means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Article III. The Commission A.The Education Commission of the States, hereinafter called “the commission,” is hereby established. The commission shall consist of seven members representing each party state. One of such members shall be the Governor; two shall be members of the state legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine; and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, six members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the Governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and non-public educational leadership. Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the Governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed ten (10) non-voting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one (1) year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration. B.The members of the commission shall be entitled to one vote each on the commission. No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof. Action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III J. C.The commission shall have a seal. D.The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, who shall be a governor, a vice chairman and a treasurer. The commission shall provide for the appointment of an executive director. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine. The executive director shall be secretary. E.Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission. F.The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any party jurisdiction, the United States, or any subdivision or agency of the aforementioned governments, or from any agency of two or more of the party jurisdictions or their subdivisions. G.The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph F of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender. H.The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein. I.The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states. J.The commission annually shall make to the Governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year. The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable. Article IV. Powers In addition to authority conferred on the commission by other provisions of the compact, the commission shall have authority to: 1.Collect, correlate, analyze and interpret information and data concerning educational needs and resources. 2.Encourage and foster research in all aspects of education, but with special reference to the desirable scope of instruction, organization, administration, and instructional methods and standards employed or suitable for employment in public educational systems. 3.Develop proposals for adequate financing of education as a whole and at each of its many levels. 4.Conduct or participate in research of the types referred to in this article in any instance where the commission finds that such research is necessary for the advancement of the purposes and policies of this compact, utilizing fully the resources of national associations, regional compact organizations for higher education, and other agencies and institutions, both public and private. 5.Formulate suggested policies and plans for the improvement of public education as a whole, or for any segment thereof, and make recommendations with respect thereto, available to the appropriate governmental units, agencies and public officials. 6.Do such other things as may be necessary or incidental to the administration of any of its authority or functions pursuant to this compact. Article V. Cooperation with Federal Government A.If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the commission by not to exceed ten (10) representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, and may be drawn from any one or more branches of the federal government, but no such representative shall have a vote on the commission. B.The commission may provide information and make recommendations to any executive or legislative agency or officer of the federal government concerning the common educational policies of the states, and may advise with any such agencies or officers concerning any matter of mutual interest. Article VI. Committees A.To assist in the expeditious conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall elect a steering committee of thirty-two (32) members which, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the commission. One-fourth (1/4) of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of Governors, one-fourth (1/4) shall consist of legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the commission. A federal representative on the commission may serve with the steering committee, but without vote. The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two (2) years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the commission shall be elected as follows: sixteen (16) for one (1) year and sixteen (16) for two (2) years. The chairman, vice chairman, and treasurer of the commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices. Vacancies in the steering committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the commission at its next regular ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term. No person shall serve more than two (2) terms as a member of the steering committee; provided that service for a partial term of one (1) year or less shall not be counted toward the two (2) term limitation. B.The commission may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any advisory or technical committee may, on request of the states concerned, be established to consider any matter of special concern to two (2) or more of the party states. C.The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide. Article VII. Finance A.The commission shall advise the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party state of its budget and estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state. Each of the commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. B.The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states. In making such apportionment, the commission shall devise and employ a formula which takes equitable account of the populations and per capita income levels of the party states. C.The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party states. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to Article III G of this compact, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it pursuant to Article III G thereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same. D.The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual reports of the commission. E.The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission. F.Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission. Article VIII. Eligible Parties — Entry into and Withdrawal A.This compact shall have as eligible parties all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In respect of any such jurisdiction not having a Governor, the term “Governor,” as used in this compact, shall mean the closest equivalent official of such jurisdiction. B.Any state or other eligible jurisdiction may enter into this compact and it shall become binding thereon when it has adopted the same: Provided that in order to enter into initial effect, adoption by at least ten (10) eligible party jurisdictions shall be required. C.Adoption of the compact may be either by enactment thereof or by adherence thereto by the Governor; provided that in the absence of enactment, adherence by the Governor shall be sufficient to make his state a party only until December 31, 1967. During any period when a state is participating in this compact through gubernatorial action, the Governor shall appoint those persons who, in addition to himself, shall serve as the members of the commission from his state, and shall provide to the commission an equitable share of the financial support of the commission from any source available to him. D.Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1967 in accordance with paragraph C of this article, any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal. Article IX. Construction and Severability This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_156_715"><akn:num>156.715</akn:num><akn:heading>Kentucky members of interstate commission.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>The Kentucky representation on the commission provided by Article III of the compact consists of seven (7) members, one (1) of whom shall be the Governor; two (2) of whom shall be members of the General Assembly, a representative and a senator, selected by the Legislative Research Commission in accordance with KRS 8.080; and four (4) of whom shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_156_720"><akn:num>156.720</akn:num><akn:heading>Bylaws, where filed.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Pursuant to Article III(I.) of the compact, the commission established by the compact shall file a copy of its bylaws and any amendment thereto with the Legislative Research Commission.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_156_730"><akn:num>156.730</akn:num><akn:heading>Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p /></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_156_735"><akn:num>156.735</akn:num><akn:heading>Rights of students of civilian military employees same as those afforded in KRS 156.730.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p /></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_156_730"><akn:num>156.730</akn:num><akn:heading>Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>ARTICLE I.

This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student. D.Placement flexibility: Local education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving course or program prerequisites, or other preconditions for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the local education agency. E.Absence as related to deployment activities: A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active member of the uniformed services, as defined by this compact, and has been called to active duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with his or her parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.

B.Exit exams - States shall accept: 1.Exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state; 2.National norm-referenced achievement tests; or 3.Alternative testing, in lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state. In the event the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student transferring in his or her senior year, then the provisions of Article VII, C shall apply. C.Transfers during senior year: Should a military student transferring at the beginning or during his or her senior year be ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of diploma from the sending local education agency if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with sections A and B of this Article. ARTICLE VIII.

A member state that does not have a school district deemed to contain a high concentration of military children may appoint a superintendent from another school district to represent local education agencies on the State Council. B.The State Council of each member state shall appoint or designate a military family education liaison to assist military families and the state in facilitating the implementation of this compact. C.The compact commissioner responsible for the administration and management of the state’s participation in the compact shall be appointed by the Governor or as otherwise determined by each member state.

The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session. The executive committee shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and other such duties as deemed necessary. The U.S. Department of Defense shall serve as an ex-officio, nonvoting member of the executive committee.

All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote or the Interstate Commission. I.Collect standardized data concerning the educational transition of the children of military families under this compact as directed through its rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection, and data exchange and reporting requirements. Such methods of data collection, exchange, and reporting shall, in so far as is reasonably possible, conform to current technology and coordinate its information functions with the appropriate custodian of records as identified in the bylaws and rules. J.Create a process that permits military officials, education officials, and parents to inform the Interstate Commission if and when there are alleged violations of the compact or its rules or when issues subject to the jurisdiction of the compact or its rules are not addressed by the state or local education agency. This subsection shall not be construed to create a private right of action against the Interstate Commission or any member state. ARTICLE X.

B.The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson, or in the chairperson’s absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.

The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not be a member of the Interstate Commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission. D.The Interstate Commission’s executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. 1.The liability of the Interstate Commission’s executive director and employees or Interstate Commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person’s employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person’s state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents.

ARTICLE XII. Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission A.Rulemaking Authority: The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. B.Rulemaking Procedure: Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the “Model State Administrative Procedure Act,” of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate Commission.

Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states. 5.The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination, including obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination. 6.The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state. 7.The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. 3.The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession. ARTICLE XIV.

The action of the principal, in addition to or in lieu of any other procedure available, may be appealed by the child or the child’s parent or guardian to the superintendent of the school system or to the Circuit Court in the county in which the school is located, and the appealing party may be represented by counsel.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_158_153__point_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>No school, school administrator, teacher, or other school employee who has custody of records received or maintained by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 or who has received information contained in or relating to a record received by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 shall disclose the fact of the record’s existence, or any information contained in the record or received from the record to any other person, including but not limited to other teachers, school employees, pupils, or parents other than the pupil, or parents of the pupil who is the subject of the record.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_158_153__point_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>The child and his parent or guardian shall have a civil cause of action against the school board and against any school administrator violating subsection (1) or (2) of this section or divulging information in violation of KRS 610.345 or 610.340.

Performance shall be based on a combination of academic and school quality indicators and measures, hereinafter called “state indicators.” The state indicators shall exclusively include: 1.Student assessment results; 2.Progress toward achieving English proficiency by limited English proficiency students; 3.Quality of school climate and safety; 4.High school graduation rates; 5.Postsecondary readiness for each high school student, which shall be included as an academic indicator, and shall be measured by one (1) of the following: a.Meeting or exceeding a college readiness benchmark score on the college admissions examination used as the statewide assessment in KRS 158.6453(5)(b)5. or a college placement examination approved by the Council on Postsecondary Education. The college readiness benchmark score shall be established by the Council on Postsecondary Education; b.Achieving three (3) hours of college credit or postsecondary articulated credit by completing a course approved by the Kentucky Board of Education; c.Achieving a benchmark score on an Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Advanced International, or other nationally recognized exam approved by the Kentucky Board of Education that generally qualifies the student for three (3) or more hours of college credit; d.Completing a required number of hours or achieving a benchmark within an apprenticeship, cooperative, or internship that is aligned with a credential or associate degree and approved by the Kentucky Board of Education after receiving input from the Local Superintendents Advisory Council; or e.Achieving any industry-recognized certifications, licensures, or credentials, with more weight in accountability for industry-recognized certifications, licensures, or credentials identified as high demand in accordance with the process described in paragraph (e) of this subsection. Eligible industry-recognized certifications, licensures, or credentials shall not be limited to those earned in conjunction with a minimum sequence of courses. Each high school shall publicly report the credits, hours, and credentials on an annual basis; and 6.Any other factor mandated by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-95, or its successor. (c) 1.Beginning with data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years, the accountability system performance for each district, school, and student subgroup determined by the state indicators shall be based on a combination of annual performance, hereinafter called “status,” and improvement over time, hereinafter called “change.” 2.Status and change shall receive equal weight in determining overall performance. For all students as a group and separately for individual subgroups, status shall be determined, beginning with the data from the 2020-2021 academic year, by using the current year performance and change shall be determined, beginning with the data from the 2021-2022 academic year, by using the difference in performance from the prior to current year, except change shall be based on the difference in performance for the prior three (3) years for the purpose of determining the lowest-performing five percent (5%) of schools under KRS 160.346(2) and (3). 3.For each state indicator, there shall be five (5) status levels ranging from very high to very low and five (5) change levels ranging from increased significantly to declined significantly. 4.The percentile cut scores for status and change levels shall be based on distribution and shall be approved by the Kentucky Department of Education and the Local Superintendents Advisory Council. The cut scores shall remain in place for at least six (6) years unless existing cut scores no longer support meaningful differentiation of schools as required by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-95, or its successor. (d)Beginning in the fall of 2022, the Kentucky Department of Education shall develop an online display of the accountability system results hereinafter called a “dashboard.” A color-coded performance level for each state indicator shall be displayed in a straightforward manner on the dashboard for overall performance, status, and change by district, school, and individual subgroups. Overall performance shall aggregate all available data for the state indicators. (e)Based on data from the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics, each local workforce investment board, in conjunction with local economic development organizations from its state regional sector, shall annually compile a list of industry-recognized certifications, licensures, and credentials specific to the state and regional workforce area, rank them by demand for the state and regional area, and provide the list to the Kentucky Workforce Innovation Board. The Kentucky Workforce Innovation Board, in conjunction with the Kentucky Department of Education, may revise the lists before the Kentucky Department of Education disseminates the lists to all school districts to be used as postsecondary readiness indicators. (f) 1.The Kentucky Department of Education shall pay for the cost of an assessment taken by a high school student for attaining an industry-recognized certification, credential, or licensure if the student consecutively completes at least two (2) related career pathway courses approved by the department prior to taking the assessment. 2.If a high school student has not completed the two (2) course requirement described in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph but meets performance-based experience eligibility and passes an assessment, the department shall provide a weighted reimbursement amount to the school district for the cost of the assessment based on the level of demand of the certificate, credential, or license earned. The Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing the performance-based experience eligibility requirements and weighted reimbursement amounts. (g)Prior to promulgating administrative regulations to revise the accountability system, the board shall seek advice from the School Curriculum, Assessment, and Accountability Council; the Office of Education Accountability; the Education Assessment and Accountability Review Subcommittee; and the department’s technical advisory committee.</akn:p><akn:point eId="sec_158_6455__point_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>A student’s test scores shall be counted in the accountability measure of:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>(a) 1.The school in which the student is currently enrolled if the student has been enrolled in that school for at least a full academic year as defined by the Kentucky Board of Education; or 2.The school in which the student was previously enrolled if the student was enrolled in that school for at least a full academic year as defined by the Kentucky Board of Education; and (b)The school district if the student is enrolled in the district for at least a full academic year as defined by the Kentucky Board of Education; and (c)The state if the student is enrolled in a Kentucky public school prior to the beginning of the statewide testing period.</akn:p><akn:point eId="sec_158_6455__point_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>After receiving the advice of the Office of Education Accountability; the School Curriculum, Assessment, and Accountability Council; and the department’s technical advisory committee, the Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate an administrative regulation in conformity with KRS 158.6471 and 158.6472 and KRS Chapter 13A to establish more rigorous action, intervention, and appropriate consequences for schools that fail to exit comprehensive support and improvement status described in KRS 160.346.

The General Assembly further finds that this has been desirable and in furtherance of an efficient system of common schools. As urbanization increases, and school districts throughout the Commonwealth become more densely populated, available school sites within such districts will proportionately diminish, and it will with increasing frequency be necessary to construct schools on land not within the district of the school board constructing such schools. When a school is so located, it is more efficient for the school district constructing the school, but it is less efficient for the statewide system of common schools and for the children residing in the immediate neighborhood of the new school, who reside in a different school district, and therefore must be transported to other, more distant schools. This situation results in an inefficient utilization of state and local school funds and school facilities, and is a result of the artificially-drawn school district boundary lines. The General Assembly further finds that the discretionary method of transfer presently provided by KRS 160.045 is not adequate to assure an efficient operation of the common schools, and that it is desirable to provide for mandatory transfer of such areas. Pursuant to section 183 of the Kentucky Constitution, the General Assembly declares that such situations are special situations and require special treatment. It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide by this statute a special method whereby such areas may be transferred to the school district operating the school or schools.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_160_048__point_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>If seventy-five percent (75%) of either the registered voters or property owners in an area adjacent to a school district other than the district in which such area is located and in which area there is located a school owned and operated by such adjacent school district petition the school board of the school district which owns and operates such school and the school board of the school district in which such area is located for the transfer of such area from the school district in which it is located to the school district which owns and operates such school, then such area shall be so transferred.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:point eId="sec_160_048__point_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>The effective date of such transfer shall be sixty (60) days after the date on which the petition is filed with the two (2) school boards; personal delivery of said petition to any member of the school board or to the superintendent of the school district shall constitute “filing” for purposes of this section.

The sole purpose of this account shall be to authorize the Department of Revenue to refund school taxes. This account shall not lapse. Refunds shall be made in accordance with the provisions in KRS 134.580(6), and when the taxpayer has made an overpayment or a payment where no tax was due as defined in KRS 134.580(7), within four (4) years of payment.

As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:point><akn:p>ARTICLE II.

The council shall be composed of the commissioner of education, a faculty member, a student member, and thirteen (13) citizen members appointed by the Governor. The citizen members shall be confirmed by the Senate under KRS 11.160, and the commissioner of education shall serve as a nonvoting ex officio member. Citizen council members shall be selected from a list of nominees provided to the Governor under the nominating process set forth in KRS 164.005.
